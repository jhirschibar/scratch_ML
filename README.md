# scratch_ML
Homemade, from scratch, Machine Learning algorithms using only numpy, pandas, and python.

## ForestEnsemble:
Random forest classifier coded without pandas. It uses an Out-of-bag error estimator for binary classification. Demonstrates recursion while evaluating entropy loss between the decision nodes of each tree.
